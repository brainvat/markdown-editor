# Mac MD - The Engineering Journey

## The Big Picture

Picture this: You're working on a long technical document, switching between plain text and a browser to see how it renders. Frustrating, right? That's the problem we're solving with **Mac MD** - a beautiful, distraction-free Markdown editor with a live preview sitting right next to your text.

**Mac MD** is a modern Universal App that works seamlessly on your Mac, iPad, and iPhone. Write on your Mac during the day, polish on your iPad on the couch, and make quick edits on your iPhone when inspiration strikes. Everything syncs through iCloud. It's like having one brain across all your devices.

Built with SwiftUI for buttery-smooth interfaces, SwiftData for elegant data management, and Swift 6 for rock-solid concurrency. Think of it as a modern take on classic Markdown editing, reimagined for 2026.

## Architecture Deep Dive

Think of Mac MD like a restaurant kitchen:

### The Data Layer (The Walk-In Cooler)
**SwiftData** is our walk-in cooler - everything gets stored here, perfectly organized. We have four main "shelves":

1. **Documents** - The main dishes. Each one is a Markdown file with content, metadata, and history.
2. **Snippets** - Pre-made ingredients. Reusable chunks of Markdown you use all the time.
3. **Projects** - Meal courses. Collections of related documents.
4. **Tags** - Flavor profiles. A document can have multiple tags, and tags can be on multiple documents (many-to-many relationship).

**CloudKit** is like having multiple restaurant locations that share inventory in real-time. Change something on your Mac? Your iPad knows about it almost instantly.

### The Service Layer (The Sous Chefs)
These are the workers behind the scenes:

- **MarkdownManager** - The head chef. Takes raw Markdown text and transforms it into beautiful HTML, handles LaTeX math expressions, and knows all the recipes (CommonMark, GFM).
- **ExportService** - The pastry chef. Takes that rendered content and packages it as PDF or HTML files.
- **SyntaxHighlighter** - The food stylist. Makes your code blocks look gorgeous with proper coloring.

### The UI Layer (The Dining Room)
This is what the customer sees:

- **Three-Column Layout** - Like a sushi bar where you can see everything: the menu (source list), today's specials (document list), and the chef preparing your order (editor + preview).
- **Responsive Design** - On a big Mac screen, you get the full sushi bar experience. On an iPad, maybe two columns. On an iPhone, it's more like a food truck window - one thing at a time, but still delicious.

### Why This Architecture?

We chose **SwiftData** because it's Apple's future. Core Data is the old guard - powerful but complex, like a French kitchen brigade. SwiftData is modern and Swift-native, like a efficient farm-to-table kitchen.

**SwiftUI** because building separate UIKit (iOS) and AppKit (macOS) interfaces would be like running two completely different restaurants. SwiftUI is one kitchen that adapts its dishes to any venue.

**Swift 6 strict concurrency** because data races are like cross-contamination in a kitchen - unacceptable. Strict concurrency is our HACCP plan, making sure every operation happens safely.

```

**Navigation Rule**: If it manipulates data, it's a Service. If it displays data, it's a View. If it defines data structure, it's a Model. Simple as that.

## Tech Stack & Why

### SwiftData (Persistence Layer)
**Why**: Successor to Core Data. Less boilerplate, more Swift-native, better type safety. Using Core Data in 2026 would be like using a flip phone - sure, it works, but why?

**The Alternative**: Core Data. But have you seen the entity description files and NSManagedObject subclass generation? SwiftData's `@Model` macro does all that with one line.

### SwiftUI (UI Layer)
**Why**: Write once, run everywhere. The three-column layout code is IDENTICAL on macOS and iOS - SwiftUI just adapts it. Before SwiftUI, we'd need separate UIKit and AppKit code. That's double the work and double the bugs.

**The Trade-off**: SwiftUI is still maturing. Some advanced text editing features might be harder than with AppKit's NSTextView. But the cross-platform benefits crush the drawbacks.

### CloudKit (Sync Layer)
**Why**: It's free (up to generous limits), deeply integrated with Apple platforms, and respects user privacy. The alternative is rolling our own sync server or paying for Firebase.

**The Gotcha**: CloudKit syncing isn't instant. Changes can take seconds to minutes to propagate. This is fine for a document editor (not a chat app), but we need to design for it.

### MarkdownUI or Ink (Parsing)
**Why**: Don't reinvent the wheel. These libraries handle the gnarly details of Markdown parsing (did you know there are like 5 different "standards"?). We just feed in text, get out AST or HTML.

**Which One**: TBD. Ink is pure Swift, lightweight. MarkdownUI is a full SwiftUI rendering solution. We'll evaluate based on LaTeX support and performance.

## The Journey

### Day 1: Project Inception
**What We're Building**: A modern Markdown editor that works on Mac, iPad, and iPhone.

**Initial Decisions**:
- ✅ Swift 6 strict concurrency (future-proof)
- ✅ SwiftData + CloudKit (modern data stack)
- ✅ Universal App (all platforms, one codebase)
- ✅ Three-column NavigationSplitView (follows macOS conventions, adapts to iOS)

**Starting Point**: Fresh Xcode project with basic SwiftData template (Item.swift with timestamp).

**The Plan**:
1. Design data models (Document, Snippet, Project, Tag, Group)
2. Build MarkdownManager for parsing and rendering
3. Create the three-column UI shell
4. Implement live preview
5. Add editor intelligence (auto-completion, syntax highlighting)
6. Build export (PDF, HTML)
7. Polish and optimize

**Initial Questions**:
- Which Markdown library? (Ink vs MarkdownUI vs swift-markdown)
- LaTeX rendering approach? (MathJax via WKWebView vs native?)
- Syntax highlighting? (Splash vs Highlightr vs custom?)

These will be answered as we build.

## Engineer's Wisdom

### SwiftData Best Practices Demonstrated Here

1. **Relationships Go Both Ways**: If a Document has Tags, make sure Tag has Documents. SwiftData needs this for proper cascading deletes and queries.

2. **@Model vs @Observable**: Use `@Model` for persisted entities, `@Observable` for view models. They're not interchangeable.

3. **Query at the View Level**: Use `@Query` in views, not in view models. SwiftData is designed for views to query directly.

4. **ModelContext is Main-Thread Only**: Always do inserts/deletes on `@MainActor`. For background processing, create a new ModelContext on a background thread.

### Swift Concurrency Patterns

1. **@MainActor for UI**: Any class that updates views gets `@MainActor`. This prevents data races and ensures smooth updates.

2. **Actors for Isolated State**: Services like MarkdownManager that do heavy processing? Make them actors. This prevents multiple simultaneous renders from stepping on each other.

3. **Async/Await, Never Callbacks**: We're in 2026. Completion handlers are legacy code. Everything is async/await.

### Universal App Design

1. **Size Classes, Not Platform Checks**: Don't write `#if os(macOS)`. Use environment values like `horizontalSizeClass` instead. More flexible and testable.

2. **Toolbar vs NavigationBar**: Use `.toolbar` modifier - it adapts automatically. On macOS it's a toolbar, on iOS it's a nav bar.

3. **Test on All Devices**: SwiftUI's promise is "write once, run everywhere." The reality is "write once, debug everywhere." Test on Mac, iPad (all orientations), and iPhone regularly.

## If I Were Starting Over...

**Too Early to Say** - We just started! But I'll update this section as we learn what works and what doesn't.

## Lessons Learned

### Day 1 Progress: Core Architecture Complete ✅

**What We Built**:
1. ✅ Complete SwiftData schema (Document, Tag, Project, Snippet, Group)
2. ✅ Three-column NavigationSplitView layout
3. ✅ MarkdownManager with basic parsing and export capabilities
4. ✅ Live preview using WKWebView
5. ✅ CloudKit syncing enabled
6. ✅ Cross-platform support (macOS/iOS/iPadOS)

**Aha Moments**:

1. **@Observable vs ObservableObject** - Initially tried using `ObservableObject` with `@Published` for MarkdownManager, but that requires Combine. Swift's new `@Observable` macro (from Observation framework) is the modern, cleaner approach for Swift 6. Just add `@Observable` and your properties automatically become observable!

2. **Platform-Specific Views Done Right** - HSplitView and VSplitView are macOS-only. Instead of fighting it, we embraced `#if os(macOS)` with elegant fallbacks for iOS using HStack/VStack with proper frame management. This is where "write once, run everywhere" becomes "write once, adapt gracefully."

3. **SwiftData Relationships Are Bidirectional** - When you have a many-to-many relationship (Documents ↔ Tags), you MUST define BOTH sides with the `inverse` parameter. Otherwise SwiftData can't properly track changes and cascade deletes.

**Bug Battles**:

1. **The Missing Combine Import** - First build error: `ObservableObject` wasn't available because we didn't import Combine. But wait - we're using Swift 6! The fix? Switch to `@Observable` macro instead. This was a blessing in disguise - forced us to use modern Swift patterns.

2. **NSViewRepresentable vs UIViewRepresentable** - WebView needs different implementations for macOS (NSViewRepresentable) vs iOS (UIViewRepresentable). Used `#if canImport(AppKit)` to create platform-specific versions. The beauty? The parent view (MarkdownPreviewView) doesn't care - same interface, different implementations.

**Gotchas Avoided**:

1. **ModelContainer Configuration** - CloudKit syncing is literally one parameter: `cloudKitDatabase: .automatic`. But you need the CloudKit entitlement enabled first, or it silently fails. The entitlements file was already set up, so we just needed to add the parameter.

2. **@Bindable vs @Binding** - In EditorView, we use `@Bindable var document: Document` (not `@Binding`). Why? Because `Document` is a `@Model` class, and `@Bindable` is specifically designed for SwiftData models. It creates two-way bindings to model properties.

3. **WKWebView Background** - On macOS, WKWebView has a white background by default. Set `drawsBackground = false` to make it transparent. On iOS, use `isOpaque = false` and `backgroundColor = .clear`. Different APIs, same goal.

**Performance Wins**:

1. **Debounced Preview Updates** - Instead of re-rendering HTML on every keystroke, we use `Task.sleep(for: .milliseconds(300))` after the `onChange` trigger. This batches rapid changes and prevents preview flicker. The user types fast, we render smart.

2. **Computed Metrics** - Document word count and character count are computed on save (via `updateMetrics()`), not on every access. This keeps queries fast when sorting by word count.

3. **@Query at the View Level** - SwiftData's `@Query` automatically updates views when data changes. No need for manual refresh logic or NotificationCenter gymnastics. SwiftUI + SwiftData = automatic reactive UI.

**Engineering Wisdom Gained**:

1. **Swift 6 Strict Concurrency Is Your Friend** - The `@MainActor` attribute on MarkdownManager ensures all UI updates happen on the main thread. No more "Purple Warning: This application is modifying the autolayout engine from a background thread." Swift 6 catches this at compile time!

2. **NavigationSplitView Visibility** - Using `columnVisibility: $columnVisibility` state gives users control over which columns to show. On Mac, they can collapse sidebars. On iPad, it adapts to multitasking modes. On iPhone, it's automatically a navigation stack.

3. **ContentUnavailableView Is Gold** - When no document is selected, we show `ContentUnavailableView` instead of an empty pane. It's built-in, beautiful, and guides the user. Apple design patterns for the win!

**What's Next**:

Still pending:
- [ ] Implement editor intelligence (auto-completion, snippets)
- [ ] LaTeX/Math rendering optimizations
- [ ] Dark mode styling refinements
- [ ] Performance profiling and optimizations

But here's the thing: **The app builds and runs!** We have a functional three-column layout with live preview, SwiftData persistence, and CloudKit syncing. From zero to MVP in one session. That's the power of SwiftUI and SwiftData.

### Day 2 Progress: v0.2.0 Feature Complete! ✅

**What We Built**:
1. ✅ swift-markdown integration (v0.7.3) - Full CommonMark + GFM support
2. ✅ Highlight.js syntax highlighting - 185 languages, auto dark mode
3. ✅ Comprehensive keyboard shortcuts - Menu bar integration with Commands API
4. ✅ Document search - Real-time filtering across titles and content

**Key Achievements**:

**swift-markdown Integration** - Replaced placeholder regex with Apple's official parser:
- Proper AST-based HTML rendering (headings, lists, tables, code blocks, etc.)
- Task list support with checkboxes
- Strikethrough, links, images with proper HTML escaping
- Thread-safe immutable types (perfect for Swift 6 concurrency)

**Highlight.js** - Professional syntax highlighting without Swift dependencies:
- 185 language support (vs ~5 with native Swift libraries)
- GitHub light/dark themes that auto-switch with system appearance
- Runs in WebView's JS engine (zero Swift performance impact)
- CDN delivery (11.9.0 from cdnjs.cloudflare.com)

**Keyboard Shortcuts** - Proper macOS app experience:
- File: ⌘E (PDF export), ⌘⇧E (HTML export)
- Navigate: ⌘1/2/3 (All/Favorites/Recent), ⌘D (toggle favorite)
- View: ⌘⇧P (toggle preview)
- Search: ⌘⇧F (find in documents)
- Used SwiftUI Commands API (not ViewModifiers) for menu bar integration
- Notification-based architecture for decoupled view communication

**Document Search** - Native SwiftUI searchable:
- Real-time filtering as user types
- Searches both title and content (case-insensitive)
- Respects sidebar filters (only searches visible documents)
- Keyboard shortcut (⌘⇧F) activates search field

**Technical Wisdom Gained**:

1. **Commands > ViewModifiers for Keyboard Shortcuts** - SwiftUI's Commands API is the proper way to add menu bar items and shortcuts. ViewModifiers work but don't show up in menus.

2. **Highlight.js > Swift Libraries** - For web-based rendering, using JS libraries in WKWebView is better than Swift packages. More languages, better maintained, zero Swift dependencies.

3. **NotificationCenter Still Has a Place** - For decoupled command handling across views, NotificationCenter with type-safe notification names is elegant and SwiftUI-friendly.

4. **searchable() Just Works** - SwiftUI's searchable modifier handles all the UI complexity. Just provide a binding and filtering logic.

### v0.4.0 Planning: Scope Realignment

**The Big Decision: Deferring Advanced Features to v2.0**

After completing v0.3.0's comprehensive CRUD operations, we hit a critical planning moment. The original IDEA.md envisioned MacDown feature parity for v1.0, including:
- Snippets system
- Editor intelligence (auto-pairing, smart typing)
- LaTeX/Math rendering
- System extensions

**The Reality Check**: These features are ambitious. Really ambitious. They're the "nice-to-haves" that sound great in planning but can delay shipping indefinitely. So we made a pragmatic call: **push advanced editing features to v2.0**.

**What v0.4.0 Actually Needs**: The boring-but-essential features that make an app ready for prime time:
1. **Multi-select & bulk operations** - Users with 50 documents don't want to tag them one-by-one
2. **Splash screen** - First impressions matter; guide new users
3. **Settings screen** - Font preferences, export locations, CloudKit status
4. **App icon** - Can't ship without proper branding across all platforms
5. **Quality assurance** - CloudKit testing, performance validation, memory leak detection

**The v2.0 Vision**: Once we ship v1.0 and get real user feedback, THEN we tackle:
- Complete Snippet system with variables and tab stops
- Smart editor features (auto-pairing, list continuation)
- LaTeX/Math rendering for academic users
- **macOS System Extension** - The killer feature: capture text from ANY app, auto-create document, auto-tag "For Review"

This is the "ship it, then improve it" philosophy. Get a solid 1.0 out the door, validate the core concept, THEN add the bells and whistles.

**Lessons for Future Planning:**
- Don't let perfect be the enemy of good
- User feedback on v1.0 will inform v2.0 priorities better than guessing now
- Advanced features are only valuable if the foundation is solid
- Shipping beats polishing every time

*Last Updated: v0.4.0 Planning - Scope realignment complete*

---

### v0.4.0: Polish & Organization — Complete ✅

**What We Built**:
1. ✅ Multi-select documents with bulk operations (delete, move to project, apply tag)
2. ✅ Welcome splash screen on first launch with sample document
3. ✅ Settings/Preferences with 10 Terminal-inspired color themes and font controls
4. ✅ App icon for iOS, iPadOS, and macOS
5. ✅ PDF export multi-page fix

**Feature Deep Dives**:

**Multi-Select & Bulk Operations** — The SwiftUI `List` natively supports multi-select by swapping the selection binding from `Document?` to `Set<Document>`. On macOS, Cmd-Click and Shift-Click work for free. On iOS, you need `.environment(\.editMode, .constant(.active))` to show the tap-to-select checkmarks — but here's the gotcha: `editMode` doesn't exist on macOS at all. Without a `#if !os(macOS)` guard, the Mac build breaks. Two separate selection states live in `DocumentListView`: one for the editor (`selectedDocument: Document?`) and one for bulk ops (`selectedDocuments: Set<Document>`). A `isSelecting` bool flips between them.

**Terminal Color Themes** — Ten presets modelled on real Terminal.app themes (Basic, Grass, Homebrew, Man Page, Novel, Ocean, Pro, Red Sands, Silver Aerogel, Solid Colors). Each theme is a `ColorTheme` struct with background, foreground, and 8 ANSI colors. Stored in `@AppStorage`, picked up live by `EditorView` via computed properties. Scope deliberately limited to the editor pane only — not the preview HTML or UI chrome. This keeps the feature manageable and avoids a rabbit hole of CSS injection.

**Settings Architecture** — macOS gets a native `Settings { SettingsView() }` scene (⌘,). iOS/iPadOS gets a gear button in the sidebar toolbar that opens a sheet. The key trap: placing `.toolbar` on `NavigationSplitView` is silently ignored on iOS — buttons must go inside the column view (SidebarView) with a binding passed down from ContentView.

**PDF Multi-Page Fix** — `WKWebView` was being created at a fixed 792pt height. Fix: evaluate `document.documentElement.scrollHeight` via JavaScript, resize the WebView to that height, wait 200ms for layout, then call `createPDF()`. Simple, but easy to miss.

**War Stories**:

**The Launch Screen from Hell** — Tried to hand-craft a `LaunchScreen.storyboard` XML with silver sheen gradients and a centered logo. Interface Builder refused to parse it with `com.apple.InterfaceBuilder error -1`. Tried fixing `targetRuntime`, removing runtime attributes, adding `standalone="no"`. All failed. `ibtool` was equally unimpressed. Resolution: you simply cannot write IB storyboard XML by hand — the format has internal consistency requirements that tools enforce. The only way in is through Xcode's File → New → Launch Screen template. Lesson: **never hand-write storyboard XML**. It looks like XML but it's not really.

**The Mac Build → iOS Storyboard Conflict** — When you add a `UILaunchStoryboardName` key to a shared `Info.plist` on a multi-platform project (iOS + macOS), the Mac target also reads it and then tries to compile an iOS storyboard for macOS. It fails with "iOS storyboards do not support target device type mac." The fix is to use `INFOPLIST_KEY_UILaunchStoryboardName` as a build setting (which Xcode only injects for iOS/iPadOS), not the Info.plist directly.

**The Mac App Icon Cache** — Getting a custom icon to show on Mac is a multi-step ordeal. The asset catalog needs a proper `.icns` file (not just a PNG) in `AppIcon.appiconset`. Even when it's there and the build embeds it, macOS may still show the old icon due to aggressive caching. `killall Dock`, `sudo rm -rf /Library/Caches/com.apple.iconservices.store`, and `touch`ing the app bundle are all sometimes needed. This is a known macOS pain point with no clean solution during development.

**The `git reset --hard` Surprise** — Reset nuked the `mac_md.png` from the asset set because it was untracked (only the `Contents.json` was committed, not the image file itself). Lesson: always commit both the JSON *and* the image files in asset sets together. Checking `git status` before reset would have caught this.

**Engineering Wisdom Gained**:

1. **Platform-conditional build settings > shared Info.plist keys** — For anything iOS-specific (`UILaunchStoryboardName`, UI orientations), use `INFOPLIST_KEY_*` build settings rather than putting them in the shared plist. This way the Mac target never even sees them.

2. **Two selection states, one list** — For multi-select UX, keep single-selection (navigation) and multi-selection (bulk ops) as completely separate state. Don't try to multiplex one binding. The `isSelecting` bool acts as a mode switch; the List binding swaps accordingly.

3. **Launch screens are a frozen snapshot** — No custom classes, no runtime attributes, no dynamic content. Whatever you want on the launch screen must be expressible purely through static Interface Builder properties. If you're fighting this constraint, a simple white screen with your logo image (no animation, no gradients) is always the right call. Users see it for under a second anyway.

4. **The asset catalog handles `.icns` generation — except when it doesn't** — For a standard iOS/macOS split project, the asset catalog compiler auto-generates `AppIcon.icns`. For a "Designed for iPhone/iPad" multi-platform project targeting macOS natively, it may not. When in doubt, generate the `.icns` yourself with `sips` + `iconutil` and add it to the bundle via a Copy Files build phase (or just drop it in the asset set).

5. **`#if !os(macOS)` is sometimes the right answer** — The SwiftUI skill says prefer environment values over platform checks. That's true for layout. But for APIs that genuinely don't exist on certain platforms (`editMode`, `UIApplication`, etc.), a platform guard is the correct tool. Don't contort your code to avoid it.

**What's Next (v1.0.0)**:
- TestFlight beta, accessibility audit, App Store submission
- Marketing materials and App Store screenshots
- The app is fully functional — this is the finish line sprint
