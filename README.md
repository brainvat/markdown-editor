## ✨ Features

### Core Functionality
- 📝 **Live Markdown Preview** - Real-time rendering with GitHub Flavored Markdown support

- ☁️ **iCloud Sync** - Seamless synchronization across all your devices via CloudKit
- 📱 **Universal App** - Native experience on Mac, iPad, and iPhone
- 🌓 **Dark Mode** - Beautiful styling that adapts to system appearance

### Document Organization
- 📂 **Projects** - Group related documents together with icons and colors
- 🏷️ **Tags** - Flexible many-to-many tagging system with colored badges
- ⭐ **Favorites** - Quick access to important documents
- 🕐 **Recents** - Smart collection of recently accessed documents
- 📦 **Archived** - Hide completed documents without deleting

### Markdown Support
- ✅ **CommonMark** - Full standard Markdown support
- 🔧 **GitHub Flavored Markdown** - Tables, task lists, and more
- 🧮 **LaTeX/Math** - Mathematical expressions via MathJax
- 💻 **Syntax Highlighting** - Beautiful code blocks (coming soon)
- 📋 **Smart Lists** - Auto-continuation and task list toggling

### Export & Sharing
- 📄 **PDF Export** - Native PDF generation with styling preservation (Mac: ✅ iOS: ✅)
- 🌐 **HTML Export** - Standalone HTML files with embedded CSS (Mac: ✅ iOS: ❌ SwiftUI bug)
- 📝 **Markdown Export** - Export as .md files (Mac: ✅ iOS: ❌ SwiftUI bug)
- 📊 **Document Stats** - Word count, character count, last modified

**Note:** iOS HTML and Markdown exports are blocked by a [confirmed SwiftUI framework bug](docs/bug-reports/APPLE_BUG_REPORT_SWIFTUI_FILEEXPORTER.md) where `.fileExporter()` silently fails for certain `FileDocument` types despite valid documents being created.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Requirements
- macOS 15.0+ (Sequoia)
- iOS 18.0+
- iPadOS 18.0+
- Xcode 16.0+
- Swift 6.0+

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:brainvat/markdown-editor.git
cd markdown-editor
```

2. Open in Xcode:
```bash
open "Markdown Editor.xcodeproj"
```

3. Select your target platform (Mac, iPhone, or iPad)

4. Build and run (⌘R)

### First Run

On first launch, Mac MD will:
- Request iCloud permissions for syncing (optional)
- Create a sample document to get you started
- Display the three-column layout

## 🏗️ Architecture

Mac MD follows modern Swift and SwiftUI best practices:

### Data Layer
- **SwiftData** for local persistence with `@Model` macro
- **CloudKit** integration for automatic iCloud syncing (disabled for development)
- Four core entities: `Document`, `Tag`, `Project`, `Snippet`
- Bidirectional relationships with proper cascade rules

### UI Layer
- **SwiftUI** exclusively - no UIKit/AppKit representables (except WebView)
- **NavigationSplitView** for adaptive three-column layout
- **@Observable** macro for reactive state management
- Platform-specific adaptations where needed

### Service Layer
- **MarkdownManager** - Centralized Markdown parsing and rendering (@MainActor)
- **Export Services** - PDF and HTML generation
- Async/await throughout (Swift 6 strict concurrency)
